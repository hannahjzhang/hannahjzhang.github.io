              <p><span class="image right"><img src="/images/projects/gifwebsite.jpg" alt="" /></span>As the outreach manager on the <a style="color:#ae85ca;" href="https://www.getinvolvedfoundation.org/">Get Involved Foundation</a> board, I was in charge of various tasks. I restructured the website, kept pages updated (such as with the graphic to the right!), added new elements when new projects were created, and lead content creation for the blog. </p>
              <p>In addition to the website, I also lead and worked on various projects for business development. I helped a lot with marketing, participating in weekly meetings, creating regular Instagram posts, and making graphics for upcoming events. When the Get Involved Foundation award was launched, I helped review applications, conduct interviews, and publicize awardees. </p>
              <p>I've also helped out with fundraising and summer courses hosted by the organization. All in all, I helped with a lot around Get Involved Foundation. Being a board member here taught me much about flexibility and learning to take on new projects.</p>
              <p><span class="image left"><img src="/images/projects/curriculum.jpg" alt="" /></span>The biggest project I undertook was curriculum development. Get Involved Foundation offers an internship program that guides teens through the process of implementing a long term service project. After having gone through the program, I realized that the curriculum available was rather scattered and somewhat confusing. So, I set out to change that.</p>
              <p>I started by looking through current curriculum resources and meeting with board members to better understand the core mission of the internship program. Eventually, I drafted out pages and organized the content into a handbook. After many graphic design edits and content iterations, I published the <a style="color:#ae85ca;" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08RH2C5H5?ref_=pe_3052080_397514860">handbook on Amazon</a>!</p>
              <p>Today, the handbook is used by the Get Involved Foundation internship program and it is also available to the general public.</p>
